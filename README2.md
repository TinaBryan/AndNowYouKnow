This is my first Android app. I have always been facinated with the stars.  
When the Hubble Telescope began sending images back to earth, to me it was only then that we were beginning
to see the wonders that have always been.
I built this app to display static random facts about space, planets and their moons, and the Hubble Telescope.  
For now it is just a simple FYI. I will be adding features to it in the future that will include images through: 
Auroral Planetary Imaging and Spectroscopy
(on my list of post semester projects, Yay!)
